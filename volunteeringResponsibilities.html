      <h1>Volunteering Responsibilities</h1>
        <p>Volunteers may be asked to work on a variety of tasks once they arrive at the pantry, including
          stocking shelves, greeting families, handing out food, and making bags of food. This is a great 
          opportunity to interact with people in the Princeton community and give back to those in need.
          Please note that when you sign up, you are making a commitment to volunteer during the time you
          have signed up for, and not showing up or canceling at the last minute could have a negative
          impact on the operations of the food pantry. If you decide to cancel/reschedule, please do so
          at least 48 hours in advance so that someone else may sign up in your place. Take a look at the 
          sections below for more information on how the volunteering process works!
        </p>
        <h2>Before You Arrive</h2>
        <p>Make sure that you have been successfully scheduled for a volunteering time slot before showing
          up. If you have email notifications activated on your account, you'll get a reminder before your
          time slot. If not, make sure to keep track of the time slots you registered for, and set alarms
          as necessary. When preparing to go to the food pantry, wear clothes that you don't have a problem
          getting dirty (which shouldn't be much of a problem).
        </p>
        <h2>When You Arrive</h2>
        <p>Enter the food pantry through the front side facing Nassau street. ADD DIRECTIONS HERE ABOUT WHERE
          TO GO ONCE YOU'RE INSIDE.
        </p>
        <h2>Organizing Food Pantry Shelves</h2>
        <p>You may be asked to organize food pantry shelves. If this is the case, there are several things to
          keep in mind. Firstly, try to maximimize the amount of the given food product in its corresponding
          case on the shelf. However, remember that volunteers need to be able to quickly access these items,
          so complicated configurations are discouraged. ADD MORE HERE.
        </p>
        <h2>Packing Family Bags</h2>
        <p>Based on the directions of another volunteer, you may be asked to pack food bags for different types
          of families. This involves putting the required number of the specified food products in each bag and 
          making sure that you have the correct number of bags. Pay extra attention to this process,
          as you may forget which bags have already been taken care of if you're not careful.
